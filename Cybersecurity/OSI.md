The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a networking system. The model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the 1980s. It divides networking functions into seven distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities. These layers guide network designers and developers to ensure compatibility and efficient data communication between different systems and technologies.


Layer 1 (Physical): Deals with physical hardware transmission.
Layer 2 (Data Link): Ensures error-free data transfer between two nodes.
Layer 3 (Network): Routes data packets between different networks.
Layer 4 (Transport): Ensures reliable transmission of data segments.
Layer 5 (Session): Manages communication sessions.
Layer 6 (Presentation): Handles data formatting and encryption.
Layer 7 (Application): Interfaces directly with applications and users.


The OSI model remains a fundamental concept in understanding how network protocols interact, even though many modern protocols like the **TCP/IP model** simplify or combine some layers.
