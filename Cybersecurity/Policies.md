Policy is informed by applicable law(s) and  
specifies which standards and guidelines  
the organization will follow. Policy is  
broad but not detailed; it establishes  
context and sets out strategic direction  
and priorities. Governance policies are  
used to moderate and control decision-  
making, to ensure compliance when  
necessary, and to guide the creation  
and implementation of other policies.  
Policies are often written at many  
levels across the organization. High-  
level governance policies are used  
by senior executives to shape and  
control decision-making process
