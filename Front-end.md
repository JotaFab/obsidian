## Frontend Development Process

- Planning: Define the project requirements, target audience, and user goals. Create wireframes or mockups for design.
- Development: Build the layout and structure using HTML, style it with CSS, and add interactivity with JavaScript.
- Testing: Conduct usability tests, browser compatibility checks, and ensure responsiveness across devices.
- Deployment: Upload the finished product to a web server for public access.
- Maintenance: Monitor the website, fix bugs, and update content as necessary.
