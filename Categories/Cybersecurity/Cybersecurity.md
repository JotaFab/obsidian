Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and damage. Its primary goal is to safeguard information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (often referred to as the CIA triad) of data. Cybersecurity measures are designed to defend against a variety of threats, such as malware, phishing, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, and hacking.

Cybersecurity is critical in today’s digital world to prevent financial loss, protect privacy, and ensure the integrity of both personal and business data.
